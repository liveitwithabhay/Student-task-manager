# Student Task Manager (Flask)

A lightweight **Student Task Manager** built using **Python and Flask**, designed to demonstrate backend fundamentals such as REST APIs, data handling, and basic persistence using a JSON file.

---

## Why Flask?

- Lightweight and minimal framework
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand
- Perfect for building **simple REST APIs**
- Allows focus on core backend logic without heavy configuration

Flask makes it easy to learn API development and request–response handling.

---

## Why JSON File Instead of a Database?

- Simpler than SQLite for this use case
- Easy to inspect and modify manually
- No database setup required
- Ideal for small projects and learning purposes

This approach prioritizes **simplicity and clarity** over scalability.

---

## Features

- Add and view student tasks
- REST-style API endpoints
- Persistent storage using JSON
- Clean and readable project structure

---

## Hardest Bugs Faced

- **CORS issues** when connecting frontend and backend on different ports
- **JSON parsing errors** due to empty or malformed JSON files

These issues helped build real-world debugging and problem-solving skills.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add **edit and delete** task functionality
- Introduce **due dates** for tasks
- Add **task categories or priorities**
- Implement user authentication
- Replace JSON with a database (SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- Build a frontend using React

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- JSON
- Git

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding Flask routing and API design
- Handling JSON data for persistence
- Debugging common backend issues
- Using Git for version control
